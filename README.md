## General Information
- This extension was originally built to help me speed up creating code names and SKUs for products. Now Ive added 4 other tools that help with creating products, keeping track of my tasks and more. I have also always wanted to make my own chrome extension and thought this would be a great one to try.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery


## Features
- Format different types of SKUs, Names and codes. Allows for lines breaks to easily work with multiple lines from a spread sheet.
- Since 6.1, Added the Page Option tool where you can easily adjust the order of page options and rename them if needed. As well as adding new page options.
- The Color Tool allows you to get CMYK and RGB values when a HEX color code is entered in. This is specifically for CloudLabs backend when creating colors.
- The Conversion tool allows you to convert numbers for millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet, yards, and points. This is to aid in the creation for templates.
- Since 6.0, Added the To Do's tool. This is a pretty standard todo list, very similar to other applications where you can set a due date, have multiple lists, re type the list name and todo's etc.
- Since 6.0, Added the notes tool. This tool allows you to save any important info for later, similar to a sticky note.

## Project Status
