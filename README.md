## General Information
- This extension was originally built to help me speed up creating code names and SKUs for products. Now I've added 4 other tools that help with creating products, keeping track of my tasks and more. I have also always wanted to make my own Chrome extension and thought this would be a great one to try.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery


## Features
- Format different types of SKUs, Names and codes. Allows for line breaks to easily work with multiple lines from a spreadsheet.
- Since 6.1, Added the Page Option tool where you can easily adjust the order of page options and rename them if needed. As well as adding new page options.
- The Color Tool allows you to get CMYK and RGB values when a HEX color code is entered. This is specifically for CloudLabs backend when creating colors.
- The Conversion tool allows you to convert numbers for millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet, yards, and points. This is to aid in the creation of templates.
- Since 6.0, Added the To Do's tool. This is a pretty standard to-do list, very similar to other applications where you can set a due date, have multiple lists, re-type the list name and to-do's etc.
- Since 6.0, Added the notes tool. This tool allows you to save any important info for later, similar to a sticky note.

## Usage
Use this app for formatting text to create SKU's, and codes, add prefixes, generate passwords, and do conversions. Since 6.0 Just recently added the ability to add to-do lists, and notes and now in 6.1 added a tool to help with page options. Sorting them and renaming them.


## Project Status
The project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Add CSV functionality, copy cells from CSV or Excel and return formatted values
- Continue to add tools that will help speed up the process of creating products, codes, names, and more.
